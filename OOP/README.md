Task 1 - Chat Messaging
The code includes classes for creating users, sending and receiving 
messages, and managing a chat history. The classes include:

User: Represents a user in the chat.
Message: Inherits from User and represents a message sent by a user.
Chat: Inherits from Message and manages the chat history.
The code demonstrates creating users, sending and receiving messages, and 
displaying the chat history.

Task 2 - Function Application
The code demonstrates a custom implementation of applying arguments to 
functions using operator overloading. The class Args allows passing 
arguments and keyword arguments, and the << operator is overloaded to 
apply them to a given function.

The code shows examples of using Args to pass arguments to functions.

Task 3 - StrangeFloat
The code includes a custom class StrangeFloat that inherits from the float 
class. It overrides the __getattr__ method to enable performing 
mathematical operations on instances of StrangeFloat using attribute 
syntax.

The code demonstrates creating a StrangeFloat object and performing 
various operations using attribute syntax.

Task 4 - Matrix Operations
The code demonstrates matrix operations using the numpy library. It 
includes matrix manipulation and calculations. The initial code is 
optimized to use the in-place operators and numpy functions for efficient 
computation.

The code showcases matrix operations and calculations.

Task 5 - Biological Sequences
The code includes an abstract base class BiologicalSequence and its 
derived classes NucleicAcidSequence, DNASequence, RNASequence, and 
AminoAcidSequence. These classes represent different biological sequences 
and provide functionalities specific to each type.

The code demonstrates creating instances of different biological sequence 
classes and accessing their properties and methods.

Note: The code is presented as individual snippets for each task and may 
require some modifications or adaptations to run smoothly as a whole.
