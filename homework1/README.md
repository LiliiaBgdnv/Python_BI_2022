This utility processes the nucleotide sequence entered by the user depending on the command.

*A list of possible commands:*
* exit - terminate program execution
* transcribe - print transcribed sequence
* reverse - print the inverted sequence
* complement - print complementary sequence
* reverse complement - print the reverse complementary sequence

***Warning!***

The case of the entered sequence is retained during operation.

Be careful when typing the sequence: it cannot contain characters other than **"A"**, **"T"**, **"G"**, **"C"** and **"U"**. 

The sequence cannot contain `thymine` and `uracil` at the same time.

If the sequence is entered incorrectly, the command must be entered again.
