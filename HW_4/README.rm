Task 1: Random Forest Classifier Customization
This task involves customizing the RandomForestClassifier class by 
creating a RandomForestClassifierCustom class that implements a random 
forest classifier with parallelization using joblib. The code defines the 
class, including methods for fitting the model, making predictions, and 
calculating prediction probabilities. It also includes an example usage of 
the class.

Task 2: Memory Limitation Decorator
This task involves implementing a decorator called memory_limit that 
limits the memory usage of a function. The decorator takes soft and hard 
memory limits as input and periodically checks the memory usage of the 
process. If the memory usage exceeds the soft limit, a warning is issued. 
If it exceeds the hard limit, a MemoryError is raised. The decorator also 
provides a utility function to convert memory sizes to human-readable 
format.

Task 3: Parallel Running Class
This task involves implementing a Parallel_Running class that allows 
parallel execution of multiple target functions using concurrent.futures. 
The class takes target functions, arguments, and keyword arguments as 
input and executes the functions in parallel using a thread pool executor. 
The class provides flexibility in specifying arguments and keyword 
arguments for each target function and returns the results as a list of 
lists.
